☁️ Staff Software Engineer at Google, building private clouds. 

### What you'll find here
😵‍💫 Aimless tinkerings of someone with unbounded interests.

### What I'd like to do
💁‍♂️ I'm working on building more useful tools for the developer community. <br />
💪 Mostly to learn some new stuff, be helpful, and build some personal brand.
